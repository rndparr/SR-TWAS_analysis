# SR-TWAS Analysis Scripts

**SR-TWAS** stands for **Stacked Regression-Transcriptome-Wide Association Study**, which is developed using *Python* and *BASH* scripts for creating improved **Genetically Regulated gene eXpression (GReX) prediction models** by using an Ensemble Machine Learning technique of Stacked Regression to form optimal linear combinations of previously trained gene expression imputation models. SR-TWAS allows users to leverage multiple reference panels of the same tissue type in order to improve GReX prediction accuracy and TWAS power with increased effective training sample sizes.

This repository contains scripts for replicating the analysis presented in the SR-TWAS manuscript.

The main SR-TWAS repository can be found at [https://github.com/yanglab-emory/SR-TWAS](https://github.com/yanglab-emory/SR-TWAS).
